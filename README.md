# Alpogo notifier

I got tired of missing the events i wanted to go because they were sold out, so i decided to make a simple script that checks the Alpogo website for new events and sends a notification to my email with monthly events.  
This is a simple script that checks the Alpogo website for new events and sends a notification to your email with monthly events.

### Things that the app does:

- Sends a notification to your email with monthly events.

### Things i want the app to do in the future:
- Run every month for a specific day.
- Let users register and choose the day they want to receive the notification.
- Let users subscribe to specific places or events.
- Add a button to add the event to your calendar
